problems in working with this lab
(1) kenel using, how to know which library had been install under the environment working with
        -> download zip file on website, and put it to my path
        Seems like don't need to change the path. froblem fix in 'import nltk'

        using long time to import keras, and no error message 
(2) fail to import keras 
        -> because my Macbook using M2, so I need to install tensorflow-macos
        After installing, using same command as the Master files performance, which "import tensorflow"
        Don't need to install keras cuz it can be find in tensorflow
